## MSc Environmental Modelling Thesis

The experiments underlying this MSc Thesis can be found in `.\model\Thesis.ipynb`.

The code workflow consists of the following:

- Utility files, facilitating the download and pre-processing of data.
- Code supplied by Dr Harry Heorton (Re-gridding & Ice variables) - these are prefixed with `H_` in `.\utilities`
- The neural network code which can be found under `.\model`, including the experiments themselves (`.\model\Thesis`) and data loaders.
- Data loader configurations draw inspiration from Tom Andersson's Ice Net: https://github.com/tom-andersson/icenet-paper/tree/main/icenet setup.
